COUCH NOTES:

First, start xampp, then go to localhost in the browser, and log into phpMyAdmin
Then create the database (use utf_8_general_cli or what have you for collation)

config.php
	'K_DB_NAME', 'couchsinglepage'
	'K_DB_USER', 'root'
	'K_DB_PASSWORD', 'root'
	'K_DB_HOST', 'localhost'

If, when logging in to Couch (via localhost/WebsiteNameGoesHere/couch), you get an error saying
"cookies must be enabled to use this cms", go into config.php and uncomment the following:
	define( 'K_SITE_URL', 'http://www.test.com/subfolder1/subfolder2/mysite/' );
and replace  'http://www.test.com...' with your localhost URL. For example, it would become the following:
	define( 'K_SITE_URL', 'http://localhost/couchsinglepage/' );

COMPASS NOTES:

	*NOTE: If the following sequence doesn't work, type in 'gem list' to bash. Likely there's a bunch of conflicting gem installations.
	To remove them and get a clean ruby slate, type the following into bash: gem list | cut -d" " -fl | xargs gem uninstall -aIx		

    Setting up file structure/compass/breakpoint/sass:

        in top level bash, type the following:

        gem update --system
            
	gem install compass --pre
            
	gem install breakpoint
            
	compass create WebsiteNameGoesHere -r breakpoint --sass-dir "sass" --css-dir "stylesheets" --javascripts-dir "js" --images-dir "images"
	^WARNING: You might need to move everything from WebsiteNameGoesHere to be a direct child of the folder containing couch if you recieve
	an error when viewing in browser (i.e, if couch can't connect).

        then do compass watch ./WebsiteNameGoesHere to convert sass to css

	you'll have to manually add the "images" and "js" directory as subfolders of the WebsiteNameGoesHere folder
	also add the reset.css and normailize.css to your stylesheets directory

	remember to add the following at the top of your style.scss file: 
                    
	@import 'breakpoint';
                    
	@import 'partials/variables';
                    
	@import 'partials/grid';       //if applicable
                    
                    
	
	also import variables in your grid partial   //if applicable
                    
                    
	
	add the following to your _variables.scss file for universal box-sizing and body/html height/width:

	//UNIVERSALIS
                        
	body, html {
                            
		width: 100%;
                            
		height: 100%;
               
	}
                        
                        

	*, *:before, *:after {
                          
		-moz-box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box;
   
	}
